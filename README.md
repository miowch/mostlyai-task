# mostlyai-task

## Disclaimer
Specific bookmarks that should be checked in the first step are listed in the task:
Platform, Use Cases, Synthetic Data, Resources and Contact.

Though there is a different set of the bookmarks at the top of the website. I checked them assuming that the task is a bit outdated.

If my assumption is wrong, I will be more than happy to show how Use Cases and Contact bookmarks can be checked.
